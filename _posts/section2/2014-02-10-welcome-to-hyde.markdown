So here is the dynamic frontend **Hyde** for your Jekyll Blog! Noticed the color changing effect in the background and title? And the transition effect when changing the content? That's **Hyde** allowing you to use transition effects etc. for your *dynamic* Jekyll Site.

Hyde makes use of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to inject the content of your blog into the site. To show you how it works, Hyde comes preconfigured with a nice dark theme and some effects. Use it as it is, change the CSS or create your own Style. To add effects and manipulate the DOM you can use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) or [jQuery](http://jquery.com)). Look at the **Hyde** Sourcecode and read the documentations for this two frameworks if you want to add custom animations. Also there are some informations in the Hyde-repository on [Github](https://github.com/pyriand3r/hyde).

In addition there will be some Howtos on my blog [scriptaholic](http://pyriand3r.no-ip.org) soon.

Have fun with jekyll and hyde!
